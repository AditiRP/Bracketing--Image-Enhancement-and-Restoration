# Bracketing--Image-Enhancement-and-Restoration
This repository explores bracketing techniques for enhancing images in challenging conditions, especially low-light. By merging multi-exposure images, it improves clarity, dynamic range, and reduces noise. Applications include tackling noise, motion blur, and limited dynamic range for better image quality.
